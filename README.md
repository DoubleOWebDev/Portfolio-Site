# Portfolio-Site

I am creating a single portfolio webpage that will be thought or cloud themed.

I will flesh out my site with the basics first, starting with the nav bar, color themes, and overall layout of the page.

Afterwards I will add functionality to the webpage.

Then add some action features like scrolling and/or small animations.
